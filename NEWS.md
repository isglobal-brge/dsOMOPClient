# dsOMOPClient 2.9.0

- Support dsOMOP 2.9.0's automatic protection of the OHDSI community tools.
  `ds.omop.analysis.run()` keeps each server's protection label in
  `meta$protection` (`"standard"`, `"dp"` with epsilon, sensitivity and the
  noise standard deviation, or `"standard_fallback"`), and the result prints
  it with the estimand. `ds.omop.query.exec()` keeps the labels in the
  `dsomop.protection` attribute.
- The reopened query-library questions (per-person durations and counts,
  demographic distributions, values, quantities and costs) pool through their
  server-owned contracts like every other analysis.
- When federated analysis metadata differ because servers use different
  `dsomop.tools.mode` settings, the error names each server's mode.
- `ds.omop.dp.status()` prints each server's tools mode.
- Documentation: sticky QueryLibrary redesigns take their input from a
  community-tool loader (an assign-mode analysis-catalog entry), because plan
  and recipe outputs carry no DP provenance since dsOMOP 2.8.0; the common
  per-person questions need no preparation in 2.9.0.

# dsOMOPClient 2.8.0

- Loading tables never depends on differential privacy (DP).
  `ds.omop.plan.execute()` no longer requests DP status before execution and
  always performs the requested concept-factor harmonization, as before DP
  was added. Servers 2.7.x with exclusive DP refuse factor discovery: set
  `factor_concepts = FALSE` there, or upgrade them to dsOMOP 2.8.0.
- The shared aggregate helper no longer turns DP-exclusive refusals into a
  special fatal error. It reports clearly when a server has the OHDSI
  community tools disabled (`dsomop.tools.enabled`), and analysis failures now
  include each server's reason.

# dsOMOPClient 2.7.4

- Support dsOMOP 2.7.1's v3 snapshot-first-answer contract for
  [isglobal-brge/dsOMOP#20](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/dsOMOP/issues/20).
  Validate the persistent binding and public storage-capacity status fields,
  and include them in federation compatibility and result metadata.
- Keep legacy v2 status inspectable and explicitly labelled as old. Release
  calls require the new contract by default. The opt-in client option
  `dsomop.dp.allow_legacy_servers = TRUE` supports staged upgrades, including
  mixed v2/v3 federations, with a warning naming every legacy server: no
  first-answer binding: an unrotated data refresh can reveal whether a released
  statistic changed; see isglobal-brge/dsOMOP#20. Results retain each server's
  contract and legacy warnings, including pooled-only views; shared contract
  fields that differ across sites are `NULL`. All mechanism, provenance,
  harmonization and per-site payload checks remain in force.
- Document permanent first answers, stale-until-custodian-rotation semantics,
  automatic server-store initialization with a local identity pin, recommended
  external pinning, persistent state recovery and the default 1 GiB public
  reservation capacity. All seven primitive calculations, sensitivities,
  epsilon/delta and pooling formulas remain unchanged.

# dsOMOPClient 2.7.3

- Adapt memory-mode plan and recipe execution to dsOMOP 2.7.0's default
  exclusive DP channel: automatically disable observed factor-level discovery
  across the selected federation with an explanatory message.
- Validate and print the DP status's `exclusive` flag, retaining compatibility
  with dsOMOP 2.6.0, which omits it.
- Standard statistics helpers now surface exclusive-mode refusals as clear
  errors directing analysts to `ds.omop.dp.release()`; no partial standard
  result is returned when a selected server refuses the channel.

# dsOMOPClient 2.7.2

- Document the server 2.6.0 default-enabled DP release channel, custodial opt-out,
  derived resource/snapshot identities, privacy epoch and persistent state
  requirements. Client release calls remain explicit; no API defaults change.
