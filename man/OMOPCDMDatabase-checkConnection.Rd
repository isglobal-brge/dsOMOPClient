\title{Check Database Connection}
\value{
A logical value:
\itemize{
\item TRUE - If the connection is valid and operational
\item Error - If the connection is invalid or cannot be established
}
}
\description{
Validates the connection between the OMOPCDMDatabase object and an OMOP Common
Data Model (CDM) database. This function ensures that the database connection is active and
properly configured before attempting any data operations.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Assigns the database resource to the DataSHIELD environment
\item Executes a connection test through DataSHIELD's aggregate function
\item Cleans up by removing the resource from the environment
\item Handles any connection errors that may occur
}

The connection check is performed in a privacy-preserving way through DataSHIELD's
aggregate functions.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create database connection
db <- ds.omop(connections, "omop_database")

# Check if connection is valid
connection_status <- db$checkConnection()

# Print connection status
print(connection_status)
}
