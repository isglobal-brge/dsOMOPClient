\title{Get Concepts Catalog from OMOP CDM Database Table}
\arguments{
\item{table}{A character string specifying the name of the table for which to retrieve
the concepts catalog (e.g., "condition_occurrence", "measurement")}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
\itemize{
\item concept_id: Numeric identifier for each standardized concept
\item concept_name: Character string containing the human-readable name/description of the concept
}

Common concept types include:
\itemize{
\item Conditions/diagnoses (in condition_occurrence)
\item Medications (in drug_exposure)
\item Laboratory tests (in measurement)
\item Clinical observations (in observation)
}
}
\description{
Retrieves a comprehensive catalog of standardized concepts (concept IDs and
their corresponding names) from a specified table in an OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)
database. This function helps explore and understand the semantic meaning of coded data
within OMOP CDM tables.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Assigns the database resource to the DataSHIELD environment
\item Retrieves the concepts catalog using a server-side function
\item Cleans up by removing the resource from the environment
\item Handles any errors that may occur during the process
}

The concepts catalog is retrieved in a privacy-preserving way through DataSHIELD's
aggregate functions.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create database connection
db <- ds.omop(connections, "omop_database")

# Get concepts from condition_occurrence table
condition_concepts <- db$concepts("condition_occurrence")

# Get concepts from measurement table
measurement_concepts <- db$concepts("measurement")

# Print first few concepts
head(condition_concepts)
}
