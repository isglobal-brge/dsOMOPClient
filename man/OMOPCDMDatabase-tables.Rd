\title{Get Tables Catalog from OMOP CDM Database}
\value{
A character vector containing the names of all available tables in the
OMOP CDM database. Common tables include:
\itemize{
\item person - Demographics and person information
\item condition_occurrence - Clinical conditions and diagnoses
\item measurement - Laboratory tests and clinical measurements

\item drug_exposure - Medication records
\item procedure_occurrence - Medical procedures

\description{
Retrieves a comprehensive list of available tables in an OMOP Common
Data Model (CDM) database. This function provides an overview of the database
structure by returning all accessible table names, which is useful for exploring
the database schema and planning data retrieval operations.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Assigns the database resource to the DataSHIELD environment
\item Retrieves the table catalog using a server-side function
\item Cleans up by removing the resource from the environment
\item Handles any errors that may occur during the process
}

The table catalog is retrieved in a privacy-preserving way through DataSHIELD's
aggregate functions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create database connection
db <- ds.omop(connections, "omop_database")

# Get list of available tables
available_tables <- db$tables()

# Print the tables
print(available_tables)
}
