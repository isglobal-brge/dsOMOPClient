\title{Combine two cohorts with set operations}
\usage{
ds.omop.cohort.combine(
  op,
  cohort_a,
  cohort_b,
  new_name = NULL,
  symbol = "omop",
  conns = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{op}{Character; the set operation to apply. One of
\code{"intersect"} (patients in both cohorts),
\code{"union"} (patients in either cohort), or
\code{"setdiff"} (patients in \code{cohort_a} but not \code{cohort_b}).}

\item{cohort_a}{Character; server-side symbol name for the first cohort
temp table.}

\item{cohort_b}{Character; server-side symbol name for the second cohort
temp table.}

\item{new_name}{Character; symbol name for the combined result. If
\code{NULL} (the default), an auto-generated name is used.}

\item{symbol}{Character; the session symbol used when the OMOP connection
was initialised (default: \code{"omop"}).}

\item{conns}{DSI connection object(s). If \code{NULL} (the default), the
connections stored in the active session are used.}
}
\value{
Invisibly; the server-side symbol name (character) for the
  combined cohort table.
}
\description{
Combines two existing server-side cohort tables using a set operation
(intersection, union, or set difference). The result is assigned as a
new server-side symbol that can be used in subsequent queries or plan
executions.

# Patients with both diabetes AND hypertension
