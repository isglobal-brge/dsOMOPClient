\title{Create a cohort reference for the plan DSL (client-only)}
\usage{
ds.omop.cohort.ref(cohort_definition_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{cohort_definition_id}{Integer; the ID of an existing cohort
definition that has already been created on the server(s).}
}
\value{
A named list with class-implicit structure containing
  \code{type = "cohort_table"} and \code{cohort_definition_id}. Intended
  for use inside plan population specifications.
}
\description{
Builds a lightweight cohort reference object that can be embedded in a
plan specification. This is a client-side-only helper that does not
contact any server; the reference is resolved at plan execution time
when \code{recipe_execute()} runs on the server.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
ref <- ds.omop.cohort.ref(cohort_definition_id = 1)
# Use in a plan: plan$population <- ref
}
}
