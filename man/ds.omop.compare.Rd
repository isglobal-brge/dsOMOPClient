\title{Compare schemas across servers}
\usage{
ds.omop.compare(symbol = "omop", conns = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{symbol}{Character; the session symbol (default: \code{"omop"}).}

\item{conns}{DSI connection object(s) or NULL to use the session default.}
}
\value{
A list with three components: \code{common_tables} (character
  vector of table names present on all servers), \code{server_only}
  (named list of tables unique to each server), and
  \code{column_diffs} (named list of per-table column differences).
}
\description{
Compares the OMOP CDM schemas across all connected servers to identify
structural differences. Returns the set of tables common to all
servers, tables unique to specific servers, and per-table column
differences. This is useful for diagnosing schema mismatches before
running pooled analyses. Requires at least two connected servers for
meaningful comparison; with a single server, returns that server's
tables as the common set.
