\title{Expand a concept set to a full list of concept IDs}
\usage{
ds.omop.concept.expand(
  concept_set,
  symbol = "omop",
  conns = NULL,
  execute = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concept_set}{An \code{omop_concept_set} object created by
\code{\link{ds.omop.concept.set}}.}

\item{symbol}{Character; the session symbol used when the OMOP connection
was initialised (default: \code{"omop"}).}

\item{conns}{DSI connection object(s). If \code{NULL} (the default), the
connections stored in the active session are used.}

\item{execute}{Logical; if \code{FALSE}, returns a dry-run
\code{dsomop_result} containing only the reproducible R code without
contacting the servers.}
}
\value{
A \code{dsomop_result} object with \code{scope = "per_site"}.
  Each server's result contains the resolved concept IDs.
}
\description{
Takes an \code{omop_concept_set} object (built with
\code{\link{ds.omop.concept.set}}) and resolves it on each connected
server. Expansion applies descendant inclusion, mapped-concept inclusion,
and exclusion rules, returning the final flat list of concept IDs that
the set represents.

cs <- ds.omop.concept.set(c(201826), include_descendants = TRUE)
