\title{Look up OMOP concepts by ID}
\usage{
ds.omop.concept.lookup(
  concept_ids,
  symbol = "omop",
  conns = NULL,
  execute = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concept_ids}{Integer or numeric vector of OMOP concept IDs to look up
(e.g., \code{c(201826, 4329847)}).}

\item{symbol}{Character; the session symbol used when the OMOP connection
was initialised (default: \code{"omop"}).}

\item{conns}{DSI connection object(s). If \code{NULL} (the default), the
connections stored in the active session are used.}

\item{execute}{Logical; if \code{FALSE}, returns a dry-run
\code{dsomop_result} containing only the reproducible R code without
contacting the servers.}
}
\value{
A \code{dsomop_result} object with \code{scope = "per_site"}.
  Each server's result is a data frame with concept metadata columns.
}
\description{
Retrieves full concept metadata for one or more concept IDs from the
vocabulary tables on each connected server. This is useful for resolving
concept IDs obtained from clinical data tables back to their human-readable
names, domains, and vocabulary membership.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Look up a single concept
info <- ds.omop.concept.lookup(201826)
info$per_site

# Look up multiple concepts at once
info <- ds.omop.concept.lookup(c(201826, 4329847, 316139))
}
