\title{Build a concept set specification (client-only)}
\usage{
ds.omop.concept.set(
  concepts,
  include_descendants = FALSE,
  include_mapped = FALSE,
  exclude = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{concepts}{Integer or numeric vector of seed concept IDs that form
the base of the concept set.}

\item{include_descendants}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, all descendants of
the seed concepts (via \code{concept_ancestor}) will be included when
the set is expanded. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{include_mapped}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, non-standard concepts
mapped to the seed concepts (via \code{concept_relationship}) will be
included when the set is expanded. Default: \code{FALSE}.}

\item{exclude}{Integer or numeric vector of concept IDs to explicitly
remove from the expanded set. \code{NULL} (the default) excludes
nothing.}
}
\value{
An \code{omop_concept_set} object (a list with class
  \code{c("omop_concept_set", "list")}).
}
\description{
Creates a local \code{omop_concept_set} object that defines a set of OMOP
concepts along with expansion rules. This is a client-side-only helper
that does not contact any server; the resulting object is passed to
\code{\link{ds.omop.concept.expand}} for server-side resolution.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Simple concept set with descendants
cs <- ds.omop.concept.set(c(201826, 316139), include_descendants = TRUE)

# Expand the concept set on the server
expanded <- ds.omop.concept.expand(cs)
}
}
